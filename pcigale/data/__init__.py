    transformed into a SimpleDatabaseEntry where each key corresponds to an
    attribute. This allows to eliminate much of the boilerplate code that is
    needed for an SqlAlchemy database. Each SimpleDatabaseEntry object is saved
    as a pickle file in a directory of the name of the database. So that it is
    straightforward to retrieve the pickle file corresponding to a given set of
    primary keys, the name contains the values of the primary keys. While this
    is very fast, it requires the use to always make queries using the same data
    types for each key (though different keys can have different types). Overall
    a SimpleDatabase is much easier to handle than an SqlAlchemy database.
