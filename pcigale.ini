# object), 'redshift' (if 0 the distance is assumed to be 10 pc),
# 'distance' (Mpc, optional, if present it will be used in lieu of the
# distance computed from the redshift), the filter names for the fluxes,
# and the filter names with the '_err' suffix for the uncertainties. The
# fluxes and the uncertainties must be in mJy for broadband data and in
# W/m² for emission lines. Fluxes can be positive or negative. Upper
# limits are indicated with a negative value for the uncertainty. In

# with NaN. This file is optional to generate the configuration file, in
# particular for the savefluxes module.

# parameter is not empty, cigale will not interpret the configuration
# parameters given in pcigale.ini. They will be given only for
# information. Note that this module should only be used in conjonction
# with the savefluxes module. Using it with the pdf_analysis module will
